    <h1 class="roboto">The top 5 fastest operating systems to restore old computers!</h1>

    <p class="roboto">So everyone has that ancient computer that takes 5 hours to start. But you can make it Usain Bolt <i>(or faster than it already is)</i> by just installing a lightweight Linux operating system!
    <br>
    Today I will be making a list of the top 5 fastest operating systems.</p>
    <h2 class="roboto"><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">5. Ubuntu</a></h1>
    <img src="ubuntu.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Ubuntu image">
    <p class="roboto">Ubuntu is the balance between performance, looks, and intuition. It is perfect but isn't as lightweight as other operating systems on this list. For a similar operating system, that is much faster but compromises looks, use:</p>
    <h2 class="roboto"><a href="https://lubuntu.me/">4. Lubuntu</a></h1>
    <small class="roboto"><i>If that wasn't a smooth transition then i don't know what is.</i></small><br>
    <img src="lubuntu.jpg" width="150" height="94"  alt="LUbuntu image">
    <p class="roboto">Lubuntu is an operating system based off of Ubuntu. Its fast and that's about it.</p>
    <h2 class="roboto"><a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">3. Damn Small Linux</a></h1>
    <img src="dsl.jpg" width="200" height="141" alt="Damn Small Linux image">
    <p class="roboto">Damn small linux <i>(DSL For short)</i> is one of the smallest <i>(ITS IN THE NAME)</i> linux installations. It can even fit on 50 MB! It completly runs in ram so you can install it on a thumb drive and while working, you dont need to worry about your USB getting disconnected*. <i>(* = programs may hang if usb disconnected, OS will work fine)</i>.
    <h2 class="roboto"><a href="https://puppylinux.com/">2. Puppy linux</a></h1>
    <img src="puppy.jpg" width="200" height="112" alt="Puppy linux image">
    <p class="roboto"> Puppy linux is designed to be extremely  lightweight. It can fit on 100 MB. Other than that and the looks, its almost the same as DSL.</p>
    <h2 class="roboto">And finally, <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/">1. Linux lite</a></h1>
    <img src="lite.jpg" width="200" height="113" alt="Linux Lite image">
    <p class="roboto">You might not use DSL or Puppy Linux for a very long, but you might use Linux Lite for a long time. It makes switching from Windows to Linux easy, is intuitive and looks and feels good.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="roboto">So this is my list of very lightweight operating systems! I hope you enjoyed the read and see you in the next article!</p>
