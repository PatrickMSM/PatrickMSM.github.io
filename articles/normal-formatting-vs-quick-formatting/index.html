	<img src="photo1.jpg" width="251" height="456" alt="Quick Format">
	<p class="roboto">Both types of formatting will clear your entire hard drive and make you a fresh new start. But which method is preferable? What is the difference between the two?</p>
	<h2 class="roboto">Answer</h2>
	<p class="roboto">Quick formatting does what its name says. It only formats your drive, unlike the normal one, which checks for errors, too. In newer versions of windows, Normal formatting also wipes your HDD with one pass.</p>
	<h2 class="roboto">Conclusion</h2>
	<p class="roboto">Quick formatting is just enough if you want to erase everything. But, if you are unsure about the health of your drive, Normal formatting is recommended. However, Normal formatting is not an alternative to wiping your hard disk drive, and you shouldn't replace shredding with Normal formatting.</p>
